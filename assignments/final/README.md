**Story/theme description：**

On this day I woke up to find myself inside a strange kitchen, and I realized that I had become a spirit, able to possess two objects: a salt shaker and a paper airplane, and able to transform between them freely. Since I wanted to know where I was and was eager to escape from this strange house, I decided to start my adventure.

Turning into a salt shaker allowed me to reach those tight places by jumping, and turning into a paper airplane provided me with some different perspectives. Allowing me to fly in the air temporarily free from gravity, which also enables me to go to some unexpected places.

In this strange and mysterious world, I will keep switching between the salt shaker and the paper airplane in order to explore the house more fully and ultimately find a way to freedom. It will be a challenging adventure, but I am determined to succeed in escaping this place.
